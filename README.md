**#Task_03: Contact Manager with Tkinter**

This Python program using Tkinter creates a simple and useful contact management application.

**Features:**

* Add new contacts with name, phone, and email.
* Edit existing contacts.
* Delete unwanted contacts.
* Clear input fields for a new entry.
* View and manage contacts in a listbox.
* Load and save contacts to a JSON file for persistence.

**How to Use:**

1. Run the program.
2. Enter contact details in the provided fields.
3. Click "Add Contact" to save a new contact.
4. Select a contact from the list to edit or delete.
5. Use the corresponding buttons to modify or remove the selected contact.
6. Click "Clear" to erase the input fields for a new entry.

**Implementation Details:**

* The program utilizes Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) elements.
* Contacts are stored in a JSON file (`contacts.json`) for persistence across program runs.
* Functions are defined for various tasks like adding, editing, deleting, displaying contacts, and handling input validation.
* Error messages are displayed using `messagebox` for missing input or selection errors.

**Further Enhancements:**

* Implement search functionality to find specific contacts.
* Add phone number and email validation for better user experience.
* Consider using a database instead of a JSON file for larger datasets.

This contact manager provides a basic framework for managing your personal or professional contacts in a user-friendly way. You can customize and extend it further based on your specific needs.
